Web-Based POS System
Thesis Title: Food Industry POS: Developing a Scalable Point-of-Sale System for Enhanced Customer Experience

This project is a web-based Point-of-Sale (POS) system integrated with a simple online ordering platform, specifically designed for food industry businesses such as restaurants and caf√©s. It streamlines both on-site transactions and remote ordering to enhance the overall customer experience.

The system utilizes AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for efficient data handling, employing JSON encoding and decoding to enable real-time communication between the frontend and backend components.

Currently, the project is deployed via Hostinger Web Hosting, ensuring accessibility and online availability for testing and demonstration purposes.
